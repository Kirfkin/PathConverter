Compiled and tested on a Lenovo ThinkPad X131e running Debian 9.4 (x86-64).
Linux Kernel: 4.0.0-4-amd64
Processor: AMD E2-1800 APU with Radeon(tm) HD Graphics x2
Memory: 3.3 GiB

Compiler: g++ (Debian 6.3.0-18+deb9u1) 6.3.0 20170516
Compiler command: g++ -W -Wall -pedantic -o keypath keypath.cpp

No makefile included (and it is likely unnecessary).

Usage: ./keypath -i INPUTFILE [-o OUTPUTFILE]

INPUTFILE and OUTPUTFILE are filepaths. -i is mandatory; -o is optional.
If -o is not provided, an output file in the executable's directory is created as the following: keypath_output_yyyymmdd_HHMMSS.txt using the time at the start of execution.

Currently, if invalid characters are parsed, for that line it will instead print out a warning, followed by the string itself. If you would prefer other handling, I hope you grant me the opportunity to submit another pull request as it should not take long to make changes to this section of the code.

Please find included files containing a sample of my test file and their solutions.
